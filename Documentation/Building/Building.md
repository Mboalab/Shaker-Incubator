## Getting started with assembly

This equipment is a shaker-incubator, designed to keep the contents at a constant temperature above the ambient temperature while providing agitation (orbital shaking). The shaker incubator is made up of 4 (four) main parts: **The electronic control box** : Centralizing the command and control of shakerâ€™s speed as well as Incubation time and
temperature; **The shaker module**(oscillating board): embeded in acrylic box and providing shaking surface ; **The heat source**: Enabling fast generation and incrementation of heat within the incubator; **The fan**: Enabling rapid and even distribution of heat within the incubator.

It is an insulated box (7mm acrylic glass) that contains a heater (lightbulb), a temperature sensor and some electronics and software that will control the temperature to keep it constant and also o adjust the speed of the oscillating board at the level input by the user. 

The primary use case is microbiology. It is essential for many protocols to have optimal growth temperature and for important microrganisms such as _Escherichia coli_ bacteria. However, most biology labs in Cameroon and elsewhere in resource-constrained contexts are under-equipped due to the high cost of lab equipment. Other use cases include washing blots, general mixing of solution and drying chamber.

To build the device you will need to undertake some basic soldering and load software onto an Arduino Uno microcontroller but you do not need to have prior experience as there are many tutorials and guides online. This build could be completed by one person in less than a week with all materials and facilities available.

## Build Steps

### Assembling the electronics

### Constructing the electronics enclosure

### Integrating the electronics with the cooler box

### Checking that it works

 - Use a separate thermometer to verify that the temperature is reaching the correct point and is maintained.
